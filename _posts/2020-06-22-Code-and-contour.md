Hi, I'm Finlay, please let me introduce myself.

In my professional life I'm a mechanical engineer working in the Scottish marine renewable energy industry, specialising in tidal turbine rotor and blade design. 

In my spare time I like to snowboard and surf. When the waves are flat or all the snow has melted I always have a few engineering side projects going, often involving 3d design, python programming, 3d printing and CNC machining.

## Code and contour

Code and contour is the working title I came up with for my blog, my favourite projects include a bit of code (G-code, python code..) and 3d contours like fins, airfoils, hydrofoils. This blog is based on my Github so it just used my ordinary github username though and the Code and Contour title got a bit lost.

## Why am I blogging?

This my first attempt at a blog, and I'm hoping to be able to use it to document my side projects and the tips and tricks I've learned along the way.

I recently created an unusual low-cost desktop CNC Router design that uses rack and pinion and 3d printed parts. The project has been really encouraging for me and I've been looking for a platform to share it on, so I'm hoping to use this Github Pages blog to do that.

## What am I going to be blogging about?

To begin with I'm just going to be blogging about my desktop CNC project, but in future I expect that will expand to wider 3d printing/CNC projects related to my other interests and composite engineering.

## Who am I writing for?

I'm writing with a 'Maker' audience in mind, who are looking to learn more about building 3d printed desktop CNC machines.

## How can you get involved?

In future I'd like to be able to enable comments on this blog to allow for discussion, but I've not got that figured out yet. Beyond that I'd like to create a youtube channel and instagram page for people to more easily follow what I get up to!

## The future

For me, this blog would be a success if it acts as an online profile for my little CNC project and helps catalyse and encourage others to get started on their own journeys of designing and making.
